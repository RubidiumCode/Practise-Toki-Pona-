# Practise Toki Pona
This is a very simple web app to help you learn Toki Pona by translating sentences.
You will be given a random snetence in either Toki Pona or English, and will attempt to translate it. Because of how subjective Toki Pona is and how many ways there are of describing something, you will have to determine if you successfully translated it or not youself. All you have to do to use it is to download the file and open it. If you don't have a Github account to report issues, either make one or DM me on discord. There is dark mode. The end.
